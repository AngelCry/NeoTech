{"name":"Neotech","tagline":"Tech Mod for Minecraft 1.8.9","body":"What is Neotech?\r\n===============\r\nNeoTech is an attempt to create a new kind of tech mod in the new 1.8.9 environment. From pipes, to generators, to machines we aim to bring all the best of older tech mods and give them a new light. Since we started in this version of Minecraft, we have the benefit of not having to port existing code. This allows us to create clean code specifically designed for this new version of Forge. Lots of thing have changed and we will always keep up with the latest changes. This includes new things like Item/Block models, IItemHanders, and whatever else comes our way. \r\n\r\nLicense\r\n===============\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">NeoTech</span> by <span xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" property=\"cc:attributionName\">Team BR Modding</span> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.<br />Based on a work at <a xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" href=\"https://github.com/TeamBR-Modding/NeoTech\" rel=\"dct:source\">https://github.com/TeamBR-Modding/NeoTech</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href='http://teambrmodding.com:8080/job/NeoTech/'><img src='http://teambrmodding.com:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=NeoTech'></a>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
